# SimpleOS
A simple yet powerfull and reliable OS. This is a publish only repo, though you are free to add your own features if you want:).
All aspects of the OS should be as simple and functional as possible.
Has a simple to use shell with explicit language that can be learnt in less than an hour.
Kernel ranks process between 1 and 5 based on priority, in case of an overload process are slowly closed.
Is fully open-source.

# SimpleShell
Simple shell is the command-line shell enviroment for Simple OS. It is currently writen in C, however this may change. The idea
is for SimpleShell to be extremely easy to use. Therefore the learning curve of learning the command line is greatly reduced. The
built in commands for SimpleShell will be explicit, for example the command "run" will execute a program with the path following it,
while the command wai (Where am I) will show the user what working directory they are working in and so on.
