# SimpleShell
Simple Shell is a easy to use and extremely effective command line for unix based systems. Unlike command lines
such as bash, SimpleShell uses explicit laungage instead of symbols in the command line to make it easier to
use. It's currently a work in progress though you are more than welcome to download and comile the current
source code and try it out however the functionality is currently very limited.

#Installation
Simply download or clone the repositry and compile the file named 'main.c' to an exe program. 
For example type: 'gcc main.c -o ssl'.
